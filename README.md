# Mini-projet-IML


This git repo presents our Machine Learning workflow applied on two binary classification problems using the following datasets:
Banknote Authentification:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication
Chronic Kidney disease: https://www.kaggle.com/mansoordaku/ckdisease

The goal behind this project is to enhance our collaborative working capabilities through the use of Github as a shared workspace. In addition, it aims at building up good programming practices for us to deliver  clean and reusable pieces of code.
